Deliverables

Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins

Use AJAX for data storage and retrieval

In addition, you must use separate files for your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and (where possible) use semantic markup for your HTML. And in general, try to stick with KISS (Keep It Stupidly Simple) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
