Deliverables

When you present your project, you must hand in the following things

A working browser game, built by you, hosted on GitHub Pages (or an alternative platform).
A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, unsolved problems, etc.
A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo
Links to wireframes and user stories, preferably in the README of your repo.
In order to get a satisfactory score, your app must:

Be deployed online, where the rest of the world can access it
Render a game board in the browser
Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
Use jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling
Use AJAX for data storage and retrieval
In addition, you must use separate files for your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and (where possible) use semantic markup for your HTML. And in general, try to stick with KISS (Keep It Stupidly Simple) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
